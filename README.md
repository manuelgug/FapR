# FapR: Frequency-based amplicon phasing in R

This script performs the phasing of resistance markers from polyclonal infections of *Plasmodium falciparum* utilizing only allele frequencies. As of now, 7 resistance markers across 4 [mad4hatter amplicons](https://www.protocols.io/view/mad4hatter-14egn779mv5d/v3) from the `dhfr` and `dhps` genes are supported.
